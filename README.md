This repository collects 237 papers related to negative sampling methods in Recommendation Systems (**RS**). Detailed information can be found in our [survey paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.2618.pdf).
We propose a overall ontology of Negative Sampling in Recommendation, which has been divided into five categories: **Static Negative Sampling**, **Dynamic Negative Sampling**, **Adversarial Negative Generation**, **Importance Re-weighting** and **Knowledge-enhanced Negative Sampling**.

- [Ontology](#Ontology)
  - [Static Negative Sampling](#static-negative-sampling)
  - [Dynamic Negative Sampling](#hard-negative-sampling)
  - [Adversarial Negative Generation](#adversarial-sampling)
  - [Importance Re-weighting](#graph-based-sampling)
  - [Knowledge-enhanced Negative Sampling](#additional-data-enhanced-sampling)

- [Scenarios](#Scenarios)
  - [Collaborative-guided Recommendation](#static-negative-sampling)
  - [Sequential Recommendation](#hard-negative-sampling)
  - [Multi-modal Recommendation](#adversarial-sampling)
  - [Multi-behavior Recommendation](#graph-based-sampling)
  - [Cross-domain Recommendation](#additional-data-enhanced-sampling)
  - [CL-enhanced Recommendation](#additional-data-enhanced-sampling)
